1. Download a labeled numeric dataset from UCI repository. Compute distances between data points construct a class-wise box plot. Transform the data to graph by using 1st quartile (whole data) of distances as threshold. Find the radius, diameter of the graph. Plot the degree distribution.
2. Download a real network and show that it follows all three properties (small world, clustering coefficient and scale free) or not (minimum 1000 nodes)
3. Compare the effectiveness of Eigen vector centrality on unweighted and weighted networks
4. Compare the communities generated by one hierarchical based, divisive based and modularity based community detection methods using a networks with predefined communities.
